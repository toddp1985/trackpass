Our members show up with a digital pass, play at your standard rate, and we pay you. It's built for courses that want more weekday rounds without any extra marketing cost.\n\nThe partner sign-up takes about two minutes at trackpassgolf.com/partner.html, or just reply here with any questions.\n\nThanks,\nTrackPass\ntrackpassgolf.com`
